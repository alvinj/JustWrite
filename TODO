TO-DO LIST

* mouse pointer (cursor) keeps changing shape as i move back and forth between this app and others
* color chooser - let the user reset to system defaults
* accelerator keys (open, save, colors, etc.)
* allow for multiple dictionaries with auto-complete
  * so i can add a Java dictionary that is separate from an english dictionary
  * so users can add their own words
* if the recent filelist is empty, don't show that menu option (deactivate it)
* these MRJ things are deprecated; fix
* let user change font
* make sure focus is returned to the mainframe after any dialogs are shown (actions)
    * this seems to be working, but i'm forcing it a lot; looks like a way to get default focus
    * do the same thing on the recentFilesList
* let user make writing area wider/narrower
* can i do something to change the scrollbar background color (or image)?
* need a good icon
* color chooser - add 'apply', undo
