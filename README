JustWrite - a Mac OS X "Full Screen Editor" application

June 20, 2010

INTRODUCTION

I created JustWrite as an experiment to see if I could create a full-screen,
plain text editor on Mac OS X using Java. 

The idea to create a full-screen editor was inspired in part by an 
application I wrote named WikiTeX, which lets me place a "curtain" 
behind the editor to hide my desktop, and my Hyde application 
(http://www.devdaily.com/hide-desktop-and-desktop-icons), whose only 
purpose is to hide a Mac OS X desktop to let you focus on your 
foreground application (whatever that foreground app might be).

LIBRARIES USED

JustWrite uses the following open source libraries:

* Quaqua (http://www.randelshofer.ch/quaqua/)
* Jgoodies (http://www.jgoodies.com/)


VERSION

There is no official version of this application yet.


BUILDING THE APPLICATION

You can just run "ant" from the "build" directory to get this build to run, BUT, 
you will need Ant installed, and will need to properly install the jarbundler jar 
file into your ant/lib folder. See the "Mac OS X JarBundler Ant Task" 
project (http://informagen.com/JarBundler/) for more information on that.

Running the "ant" command from the build directory will create a complete build 
of the JustWrite application, i.e., the JustWrite.app folder. This folder will 
be created in the "release" directory of this project.


RUNNING THE APPLICATION

To run the application, you can just cd over to the "release" folder, and then 
type this command:

  open JustWrite.app

Or, if you prefer, you can double-click the application icon from the Mac Finder.


ABOUT THE ICON

Like everything else here, the current icon needs some work. The current icon is
a heavily modified version of an icon that I first found on the MouseRunner.com
website, and is released under the Creative Commons license. See
http://www.mouserunner.com/ for more information.
